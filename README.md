Hello there, young adventurer! This is the primary repository for the Pathfinder - Races for Rimworld mod. This mod adds races, unique factions and cultures based on the universe of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Most if not all information regarding the contents not shown in the Steam mod page is presented here. It is in a alpha-beta phase, so expect a lot of change for the next updates.
