Hello there, young adventurer! This is the primary repository for the Pathfinder - Races for Rimworld mod. This mod adds races, unique factions and cultures based on the universe of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Most if not all information regarding the content not shown in the Steam mod page is presented here. It is in a alpha-beta phase, so expect a lot of change for the next updates.

# Feedback and Bug Report

While it is important and cool for me to hear your opinions and suggestions, I'll prioritize bug reports and balance issues. You can send your bug reports to the Bugs section. In order for me to understand your issue, please describe them fully, how to reproduce it and include a HugsLib log link by pressing CTRL + F12. I'll be unable to understand your issue if you don't include the HugsLib log, since it got all the information needed to know how to fix it. Also I'm not gonna read thousands of lines of log errors from gigantic mod lists (it's too tiring!)

# Features

If you want to explore more things not mentioned in the Steam mod description, click in the wiki tab in the upper side of the site or click [here](https://github.com/ComiColipze/PathfinderMod/wiki) to go directly to the wiki's Home page.
